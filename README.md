## Overview

The OCULUS MARINE Embedded Intelligent Microscopy System (codenamed Oculus Marina) is a revolutionary AI-powered add-on module designed to automate the identification and counting of marine organisms under standard microscopes. Developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2025 (Problem Statement ID: 25043, Theme: Smart Automation, Category: Software/Hardware), this system transforms any existing microscope into an intelligent tool for marine biodiversity assessment.

Key highlights:
- **Accuracy**: 96.36% species-level accuracy (top-1), 99.2% top-5.
- **Speed**: 100ms per image processing time, handling up to 850 organisms/min.
- **Cost**: Under ₹35,000 total system cost.
- **Platform**: Edge AI on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super for real-time, on-device processing.
- **Team**: OculusMarina (Team ID: 33).

By integrating multi-stage AI pipelines with edge computing, the system eliminates the need for manual examination, reducing analysis time from 6+ hours per sample batch to minutes while minimizing human error (30-40% in manual methods).

## Problem Statement
